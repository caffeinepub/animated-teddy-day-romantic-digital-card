## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page, romantic animated Teddy Day digital card with a cute/warm/dreamy pastel aesthetic, including a staged teddy animation and a love letter reveal with exact provided text, plus optional background music controls.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a single-page animated card scene featuring a teddy bear, glowing heart, love letter, floating hearts, sparkles, and soft pink/pastel background lighting.
- Implement a smooth, ordered animation sequence on load: teddy walks in → hugs the heart → opens the love letter to reveal the provided message.
- Render the love letter text exactly as provided (including line breaks and emojis) with responsive, legible, greeting-card-style typography.
- Add a replay control to restart the full animation sequence from the beginning.
- Add local background audio with user controls (muted by default / user-gesture compliant), including mute/unmute and volume control.
- Apply a cohesive dreamy pastel UI theme to the entire page and controls.
- Ensure responsiveness, reduced-motion support, and keyboard-accessible controls with accessible labels.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can open a single-page Teddy Day card that plays a smooth romantic animation (walk-in, hug, letter reveal), read the exact love message, replay the sequence, and optionally enable and control soft background music on both mobile and desktop.
